# DAO in Telegram. Powered by TON.

Build and run a decentralized organization — right where your community already lives.

***

## What is XDAO TON?

This is a Telegram-native WebApp for creating and managing DAOs, built on top of the [TON blockchain](https://ton.org/)  and powered by [XDAO](https://xdao.app/).&#x20;



!!! tip "Just Telegram"
    No external apps or complex setups required — everything works directly in Telegram.

!!! tip "Just a MiniApp"
    Lightweight interface that runs seamlessly within Telegram's ecosystem.

!!! tip "Just you and your DAO"
    Direct, secure interaction with your decentralized organization.

## App Functionality

* Authentication via TON Wallet using message signature
* Display of DAO information (name, description, address, email, social media)
* Participation in DAO voting with secure signature confirmation
* Profile and metadata management for DAOs
* Crowdfunding participation through native Telegram interface
* DAO balance overview in real time

## What problems does it solve?

XDAO TON eliminates the need for fragmented, complex access to DAOs in the TON ecosystem.

Instead of navigating external websites, installing browser extensions, or dealing with technical hurdles, users can now interact with DAOs directly in Telegram — with secure authorization, intuitive UI, and seamless wallet integration.&#x20;

### Who can use the XDAO TON?

XDAO TON is designed for all participants in the TON ecosystem who rely on DAO as a governance mechanism. Specifically, it can be used by:\
• **Venture capital funds** and **investment structures** for collaborative decision-making and transparent resource allocation\
• **Asset management companies** to manage digital assets on TON in a decentralized way\
• **Public funds** and **non-profit organizations** to increase transparency and stakeholder engagement\
• **Startups** and **project teams** to coordinate internal processes via DAO governance\
• **DeFi protocols** for protocol-level governance and community-driven development\
• **Freelance collectives** and **DAO-based teams** to jointly manage treasuries and decisions\
• **NFT communities** and **GameFi guilds** to manage roles, permissions, and assets

## What should you know before using it?

1. The app only supports DAOs created on XDAO within the TON network.\
   DAOs on Ethereum, BNB Chain, or other networks are not supported.
2. Interaction happens via Telegram WebApp, which must be opened within the Telegram client (mobile or desktop).
3. A compatible TON wallet (e.g., Tonkeeper, Tonhub, Telegram Wallet) is required to sign transactions.
4. Most DAO actions (creating proposals, transferring funds, editing parameters) require signature confirmation via wallet.

## What are the usage requirements?

* Telegram Mobile App
* Built-in Telegram WebView browser
* TON wallet (Tonkeeper, Tonhub, Telegram Wallet, etc.)
* Stable internet connection

### What about security?

* The bot never stores private keys
* All transactions require user-side cryptographic signatures
* Backend services verify token validity and user permissions before executing actions
