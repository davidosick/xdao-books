This guide describes how to deposit and withdraw funds from your DAO's balance in XDAO TON.

## How to Deposit to a DAO Balance

To deposit funds into your DAO's balance, follow these steps:

1.  **Go to your DAO's page.**
2.  **Open the "DAO Balance" tab.** Here you will see the current balance of your DAO, including TON and other jettons.
3.  **Click the "Receive QR" button.** A modal window will open with a QR code and your DAO's address.
4.  **Use the QR code or address to deposit:**
    *   **QR Code:** Scan the QR code with your TON wallet to quickly send funds.
    *   **Address:** Copy the address and use it to send TON or other supported jettons to your DAO's balance.

Once the transaction is confirmed on the TON network, the funds will appear in your DAO's balance.

## How to Withdraw Funds from a DAO Balance

Withdrawing funds from a DAO is done by creating and approving a proposal. This ensures transparency and security, as all DAO members can see and vote on the withdrawal of funds.

1.  **Go to your DAO's page.**
2.  **Open the "DAO Balance" tab.**
3.  **Click the "Send" button.** You will be redirected to the new proposal creation page.
4.  **Fill out the proposal form:**
    *   **Proposal Type:** This will be automatically set to "Send DAO Funds".
    *   **Recipient:** Specify the wallet address to which you want to withdraw the funds.
    *   **Amount and Token:** Select the token (TON or another jetton) and specify the amount to withdraw.
    *   **Description:** Add a description for the proposal so that other DAO members understand the purpose of the withdrawal.
5.  **Create the proposal.** After creating the proposal, it will appear in the "Votes" tab, where DAO members can vote on it.
6.  **Wait for the voting to end.** If the proposal is approved (receives the required number of votes), the funds will be automatically sent to the specified address.

This process ensures that all financial transactions in the DAO are carried out with the consent of its members.
