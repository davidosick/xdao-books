## After Submission

Once your proposal is successfully created:

- Other General Partners will be able to see and vote on your proposal
- You'll receive notifications about voting activity
- Voting will end when either:
  - The required number of votes is reached
  - The voting deadline expires

## Important Notes

- **Only General Partners** can create and vote on proposals
- Proposals cannot be edited once submitted
- Make sure you have sufficient tokens in your wallet to pay for transaction fees
- Consider discussing your proposal with other members before submitting to increase chances of approval

## Voting Process

After your proposal is created, other General Partners can:

1. View the proposal details
2. Cast their votes (Yes/No or other options depending on proposal type)
3. See real-time voting results
4. Discuss the proposal with other members

The proposal will be automatically executed if it receives the required consensus according to your DAO's governance rules.
