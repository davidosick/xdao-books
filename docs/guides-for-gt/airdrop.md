## How to Get an Airdrop

The $DAO token Airdrop is a reward for active users of the platform. To receive it, you need to meet a number of conditions and reserve a spot in one of your DAOs.

### Conditions for Receiving the Airdrop

1.  **Create a DAO or join an existing one.** You must be a member of a DAO as a General Partner (GP) to be eligible for the Airdrop.
2.  **Complete tasks.** On your profile page, there is a list of tasks that need to be completed. This may include linking your Telegram account and other actions.
3.  **Choose a DAO for the Airdrop.** You need to select one of your DAOs through which you want to receive the Airdrop.

**Important:** Only 5 slots are available in each DAO for the Airdrop. If all slots in your DAO are taken, you will need to join another DAO or create a new one.

### How to Claim the Airdrop

1.  **Go to your profile.** Click on the profile icon to open your account information page.
2.  **Check the task list.** Make sure that all mandatory tasks for receiving the Airdrop are completed. The completion status will be marked with checkmarks.
3.  **Select a DAO.** In the "Select DAO for airdrop" section, you will see a list of your DAOs where you are a GP.
    *   If you haven't selected a DAO yet, click the selection button and choose one with available slots.
    *   You will see how many slots are already taken in each DAO (e.g., `3/5`).
4.  **Confirm your choice.** After selecting a DAO, it will be reserved for you to receive the Airdrop.

After meeting all the conditions and selecting a DAO, you will become a participant in the Airdrop. Follow the project's news to find out the token distribution date.
