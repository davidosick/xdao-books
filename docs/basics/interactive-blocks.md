# FAQ

**Why isn’t the WebApp opening?**

The WebApp only works inside Telegram. Make sure you're using the **Telegram mobile or desktop app**, not a browser. Also, check that you have the latest version of Telegram installed.



**How do I log in to the bot?**

Select your **TON wallet** (Tonkeeper, Tonhub, OpenMask), and it will prompt you to **sign a message**—this verifies your identity. No usernames or passwords are required.



**What should I do if the signature fails?**

* Check your wallet connection.
* Ensure your wallet supports **message signing**.
* Try restarting Telegram and the WebApp.
