# Telegram Mini App

The Telegram Mini App serves as the main entry point for users to interact with the DAO. It’s a lightweight, mobile-friendly interface that runs natively inside the Telegram messenger, providing a seamless experience without requiring app installations or browser navigation.

We’re building a truly native Web3 interface — right inside Telegram. Welcome to the next generation of DAO interaction.

## Key Features

* **Seamless Login via TON Wallet.** Users authenticate through their TON Wallets using Telegram’s WebApp API and tonconnect.
* **Instant Access to DAO Tools.** Members can manage proposals, vote, and view DAO information — all without leaving Telegram.&#x20;
* **Secure by Design.** The app communicates with backend services via signed requests, and never stores private keys or sensitive data.
* **Optimized for Speed & UX.** The interface is optimized for mobile users inside Telegram, with smooth navigation and a clean, modular design.
